## This week in UCD Operations

This week is the end of our first sprint for UCD Operations. Our sprint goal was to:

> Set up the infrastructure for the correct storage of data

This week was ðŸ˜¸ because we managed to get a UCD Ops Sharepoint site created.

With the scope of UCD Operations being so vast, you may be asking yourself why? Why focus on this as your first sprint goal?

In Operations we believe that governance, data and knowledge management is the backbone of everything we do.

Also this week we have embedded our agile ways of working and evolved our service approach to how we deliver Operations.

Below are updates from each practice, if you get to the end, thereâ€™s a classic IT joke AND a gorgeous dog picture, just for you.

## If you need a smile

Don't use "beef stew" as a computer password. It's not stroganoff.
