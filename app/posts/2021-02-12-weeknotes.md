Apologies everyone, I thought I had sent last week’s weeknote. Sadly it has been sat in my drafts for a few days.

Rather excitingly we now have a content community Outlook distribution list. You can email the whole community at [UCDContentCommunity@defra.gov.uk](mailto:UCDContentCommunity@defra.gov.uk). Thank you Cerys Mainwaring for setting it up for us.


## Transition period content

Some of the team are catching up on some well-deserved leave, we’re still working on some cleanup after 31 December, including removing out of date BAU guidance and reviewing some subject areas to improve structure:

This week we’ve:
* updated a number of guides
* started work with animal imports SMEs to improve the guidance and publish some urgent NI content
* prepared content around prohibitions and restrictions for imminent publication
* reviewed and updated guidance with helpline numbers in line with a CO request
* reviewed ‘on page feedback’ for updated pages and initiated quick fixes (fish notification forms) or wider content reviews (personal imports)

## Coronavirus guidance

No coronavirus guidance worked on this week.

## Corporate content (GOV.UK and intranets)

We lead on Defra, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and Natural England (NE) corporate GOV.UK content plus guidance and corporate content on intranets. We have a co-ordinating role across the Environment Agency.

This week we’ve been working on content for:
* bird flu - no new cases but still busy dealing with existing incidents
* Defra group intranets - the DDTS business relationship manager is chasing progress  on moving the APHA, NE and RPA intranets onto the latest version of SharePoint
* accessibility - spoke to the GDS accessibility team and they have promised to provide additional guidance on the use of open document forms. More generally we plan to work with Lynne and Lucy to develop practical advice for content designs to deal with common accessibility scenarios.

## Future Farming and Countryside Programme

This programme, which replaces the Common Agricultural Policy, seeks to establish an environmentally and economically sustainable British farming sector.

Content design is mainly involved with 3 workstreams of the programme at the moment: the Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme, grants and regulation and enforcement.

This week we’ve:
* continued to update the Sustainable Farming Incentive prototype to bring it into line with the latest standards
* completed one user research session with a poultry farmer to see if we have made rules clearer
* started looking at the rules for soil

## Flood digital services team (EA flood services)

This team works on Flood information service (live), Check for flooding (beta), Flood warning service (live), NeXt warning service (XWS) (alpha).

In the past week the Check for flooding/Flood information service team have:
* been user testing the new flood forecast feature
* iterated the flood forecast feature in response to results from user testing

In the past week the XWS team have:
* started user testing on an internal prototype to select severity level and target area

## Flood digital knowledge team (EA flood services)

This team is currently working on the Get flood risk information for planning service (private beta) and the natural flood management project (discovery).

In the past week Caroline Vickers had her baby! More news when her maternity leave cover starts in early March.

## Water resources licensing service
This service is replacing the Environment Agency’s legacy system for water abstraction licensing. Ruth Fryer is in the delivery team behind ‘Manage your water abstraction or impoundment licence’.

In the past week we’ve:
* continued work on some wireframes for water abstraction alerts
* refined designs for a billing and data user to set up an abatement agreement for a licence
* iterated the water abstraction alerts content following SME review, ready to share with two EA areas for feedback around how the messages align with their local templates

## Flood and coastal erosion risk management (FCERM)

This project is to rewrite and migrate 500 pieces of content from the current CMS to Whitehall and Specialist publishers and to create a sub-organisation page for the project. We’re making the content compliant and accessible and moving most of it on to a Specialist finder on GOV.UK.

In the past week we’ve:
* given a demo to the FCERM team on how to upload content to Specialist publisher
* written step by step guidance on how to create accessible PDFs from Word
* written step by step guidance on how to retrospectively make PDFs accessible
* written guidance on how to create accessible project summaries
* carried on proofing and 2iing the completed project summaries
* given advice about why creating innovative but inaccessible content is not advised
* given advice about how to make powerpoint and excel more accessible
* started retrospectively making 31 PDFs accessible

## Export health certificate (EHC) service (public beta)

This service is replacing Animal and Plant Health Agency’s current system for applying for an EHC as an exporter or certifying an EHC as an official vet or health inspector. Sophie Smith is in the delivery team behind ‘Apply for an export health certificate’ and ‘Certify an export health certificate’.

More news next week.

## Apply for a phytosanitary certificate (private beta)

This service (name is still to be finalised) is replacing e-Domero, APHA’s current system for applying for a phytosanitary certificate and arranging inspections of crops. It is also replacing the paper forms. Sophie Smith is the content designer on this service, which has just gone into beta.

More news next week.
