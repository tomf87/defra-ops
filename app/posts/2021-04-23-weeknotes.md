## This week in UCD Operations

This week is the end of our sprint 5 for UCD Operations. We felt it was a bit average as we had to postpone the UCD Meet-up - it was definitely the right thing to do.

The new date on the 25th of May is looking SOOO good, it's going to be like a UCD disco of super cool things! ðŸ˜Ž

For sprint 6 we have the following 5 goals:

> 1. Focus on understanding the relationship between MS Teams and Sharepoint Online

We believe that an integration between MS Teams and Sharepoint Online supports the UCD infrastructure, managing user-research insights and making insights accessible throughout Defra.

This sprint goal will be confirmed when we have started a mapping exercise with lead UR's to understand the journey of the data from a research session to a secure space that ops manage (sharepoint) but with an element (insights) shared somewhere for wider project teams & stakeholders to view.

> 2. Focus on supporting people in order to amplify the value of user centred design
>    * Talk with colleagues in content to understand how we ensure that they are paid properly once they start at Defra.  

*This has been started and will be ongoing. So far we have had a great insight from colleagues coming from other government departments and their experiences. Going forward it allows us to monitor how things are progressing and ensure a smoother process for the new starter and vacancy manager*

We believe our support will give people the ability to focus their efforts on being a content specialist.

This sprint goal will be confirmed when we have identified how we stop delays to salary payments.

> 3. Focus on planning the UCD meet up to:
>    * Make it a great day!
>    * Ensure that everyone who attends will get ideas and inspiration from speakers and attendees
>    * Allow sharing of what people are struggling with, talk about collaboration.

We believe starting to plan the day now we can have a really good day on May 25th.

This sprint goal will be confirmed when we have the first draft of our agenda.

> 4. Focus on speaking to designers
>    * Understand their role, their experience of designing at Defra and working in a community of designers
>    * Understand current use of design tools

We believe running discovery interviews and surveys with designers will identify opportunities to support them going forward.

This will be confirmed when we have successfully run a minimum of five discovery interviews, and surveyed designers use of tools.

> 5) Expand the Design Community
>    * Set up regular design crits so designers can get feedback on their work
>    * Set up a working group to support best practice around prototyping

We believe setting up design crits and a working group for designers will increase the value offered to designers through the design community.

This will be confirmed when we have successfully set up design crits and working group and have run the first session for each.

Below are updates from each practice, and when you get to the end, thereâ€™s something to make you smile.

## Design - Tom Frankland

### What went well

* UCD training - weâ€™ve recently been working to obtain some service design and planet-centred design training for the UCD function at Defra. This took another big step forward this week and weâ€™re now getting much closer to being able to offer some places on it.
* Meeting all the new designers who have started this week or while Iâ€™ve been off!
* It was my first week back after moving house - so it was good to be able to take a rest from all the intense DIY of the last couple of weeks!

### What didnâ€™t go well

* Catching up on emails, Slack and admin - always a pain when returning from leave I guess. ðŸ“§ðŸ“§ðŸ“§

## Content - Cerys Mainwaring

### What went well

* Content Community Catch Up - last weekâ€™s catch up was great and many thanks to Jeni and Paula for volunteering to present.
* Even though the UCD Meet up didnâ€™t go ahead this month, we have some great speakers lined up for next month so keep an eye out for further updates!

### What didnâ€™t go well

* Some - as always - laptop/kit issues for new starters. Very frustrating for all concerned, but hoping I can speak with the Security team to see if there is any way we can ask for laptops for new starters to be delivered in advance to avoid delays. After endlessly chasing MyIT they recommended I talk to Security so Iâ€™ll test the water to see what we can do for future new starters/general kit requests
* Content team week notes - normal service will resume this week I promise! With a busy few weeks, bank holidays and other limitations I will endeavour to get them sent out again as a priority this week, so keep an eye in the mailbox as some great work is being done and itâ€™s a shame not to share it. :)

## Research - Samantha Brown

### What went well

* Further work with the awesome co design peeps Natalie and Fern on mapping out user panels. You can see the draft from the perspective of Re Ops here
* Qualtrics - Camille and team have asked some really good questions on the usage and accessibility of Qualtrics. I am working with Martin Glancy to create the best version (in terms of accesibility) that we can make a Qualtrics form.
* UR Community of practice call. We worked with the researchers to understand the good, the bad and the ugle of recruitment at the moment. So much insight that will help shape user panels within Defra - you can [view the board here](https://trello.com/invite/b/wKtPxoQ6/5d57c58fdc11f580af3cec984328efdf/recruitment).

### What didnâ€™t go well

* Nothing - all good ðŸ™‚
